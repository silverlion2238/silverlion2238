## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Michal Schubert

I'm a 17-year-old student currently attending Secondary School. I'm passionate about technology and eager to learn new things. I'm particularly interested in:

* **Dart:** I enjoy building mobile and web applications using Dart and Flutter.
* **AI:** I'm fascinated by the possibilities of artificial intelligence and its applications.
* **Copilot:** I love how Copilot helps me write code more efficiently and learn new things.

I'm excited to be a part of the GitHub Education community and contribute to open-source projects.

**Here are some of my goals:**

* Improve my coding skills in Dart and other languages.
* Learn more about AI and machine learning.
* Build cool projects and share them with the world.
* Collaborate with other developers and learn from their experience.

Let's connect and build something amazing together! ðŸš€
